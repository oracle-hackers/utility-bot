# utility bot
Utility is a discord bot written using a custom library that makes using Discord User Tokens easy.

To minimize the risk of accounts being flagged, all requests are performed via a selection of HQ rotating residential proxies, custom written headers, as well as complete json (all extra parameters). These and other security features make the request seem as they come from a selection of device types, resolutions, app/browser/mobile etc; ultimately making them ultra utltra realistic.
